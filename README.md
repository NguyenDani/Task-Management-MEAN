# Task-Management-MEAN

The Task Management App is a web-based platform designed to streamline 
              task organization and collaboration. Built on the MEAN (MongoDB, 
              Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js) tech stack, it offers users a 
              seamless experience in managing their to-do lists and facilitates 
              collaboration by allowing users to invite others to join and 
              contribute to shared lists.
